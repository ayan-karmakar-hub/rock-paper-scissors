/********** Summary ***********/

For this project, I created a simple game of rock paper scissors.

There are images of a rock, sheet of paper, and a pair of scissors on the screen.
When the user selects one of them, a round is played.
The computer will generate a random choice to compare to the user's selection.
The result of the round is displayed on the screen.
The first player to 5 points wins the game.
